**App Overview**

Our team of UX Designers, Data Scientists, and Web Developers worked together with [EarthShare](http://www.earthshare.org/) to build an interface where non-profit organizations such as Trees ATL, Park Pride, and Atlanta Audubon Society can manage job postings so that environmental speciliasts can have a platform for their specialized job search. With a social media aspect, which provides a community of green-minded people a place to find mentors and like-minded people, this site is a mecca for Green Atlantans!

**Our Proudest Moment**

Our proudest moment was learning to communicate efficiently with each other. Working with UX Designers made the process so much easier to visualize and the devloping stages smoother to achieve. The Atlanta GreenSpace Hackathon was a wonderful experience which bonded our team with a great non-profit organization!
